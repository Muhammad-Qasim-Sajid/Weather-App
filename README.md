WeatherPro is a weather application built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It fetches real-time weather data using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), presenting it through an elegant user interface done by animations, loading effects, and error handling.

##  Developer Journey

When I started this project, I struggled a lot with **API handling**. Initially, I could only fetch and display data without any kind of input validation, error catching, or loading feedback.

But I soon realized this was not enough for a good user experience. So I went back and improved every part of the app:

- Added **input validation** (empty, too short, numeric checks)
- Used **`try...catch`** for proper error control
- Integrated **`AbortController`** to handle request timeouts
- Designed detailed and contextual **error messages**
- Focused on **responsive design** and **user experience**

This app is a great experience in my frontend learning path.
